# ATLIQO-TELECOM-ANALYSIS

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

ATLIQO stands as one of the leading telecom providers in India that recently introduced its 5G plans into the market alongside other telecom heavyweights. However, shortly after its introduction, its management
team observed a surprising decline in its active users and revenue growth. 

Concerned that this visible trend might overcome their ability to enjoy a much bigger share in the market, ATLIQO's business director has requested his analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPI's between 
pre-and post-periods of the 5G launch. 

The insights from the questions included in this report would be effective in their understanding of where they are heading and what improvements they can make to retain their stand in the market.
